## Exercise 1: Install the self-hosted integration runtime on the SAP virtual machine

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, we will assume the SAP environment is either on-premises or secured via a virtual network. In order for Azure Synapse Analytics to utilize the locally hosted OData services on the SAP virtual machine, a self-hosted integration runtime must be installed. The self-hosted integration runtime is used to establish connectivity between Azure Synapse Analytics and other non-public internet facing compute resources. These can be on-premises resources and those protected by virtual networks and firewalls.

### Task 1: Download and install the self-hosted integration runtime

1. On the **SAP VM**, open the Chrome browser and log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Open the **mcw_sap_plus_extend_and_innovate** resource group then locate and open the **sapdatasynws{SUFFIX}** Synapse workspace resource.

3. Open Synapse Studio.

4. Select the **Manage** hub, then choose **Integration runtimes** from beneath the Integration header. From the Integration runtimes screen, select **+ New** from the toolbar menu.

5. On the Integration runtime setup blade, select the **Azure, Self-Hosted** card. Select **Continue**.

8. Select the link below the **Option 1: Express setup** header. This will download an executable file.

9. Run the downloaded executable. The Express Setup will download, install, and register the self-hosted integration runtime. Select the **Close** button once all the steps have completed.

    ![The Microsoft Integration Runtime Express Setup executable displays indicating the current installation progress.](media/ss_shir_install.png "Express Setup Executable")

10. Close the Integration runtime setup blade.

11. The Integration runtimes list should now display **SAPVM-SHIR** in the list.
