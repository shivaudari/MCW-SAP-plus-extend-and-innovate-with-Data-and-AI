3. On the Train a new model (Regression) blade, select **PAYMENTDELAYINDAYS** for the **Target column** field. Ensure the Azure Machine Learning workspace is set to **sap-mcw-ml-ws** and the Apache Spark pool field is set to **SparkPoolSmall**. Select **Continue**.

    ![The Train a new model (Regression) blade displays with the PAYMENTDELAYINDAYS column selected as the Target column. sap-mcw-ml-ws is selected in the Azure Machine learning workspace field and SparkPoolSmall is selected in the Apache Spark pool field.](media/ss_trainnewregressionmodel_targetcolumn.png "Regression Target Column selection")

4. On the Train a new model (Regression) blade, select **Normalized root mean squared error** as the Primary metric and set the Maximum training job time (hours) to `0.25`. Enable the ONNX model compatibility option. Select **Open in notebook**.

    ![The Train a new model (Regression) blade displays with a form populated as described. The Open in notebook button is highlighted.](media/ss_amlopeninnotebook.png "Open in notebook")

5. In the scaffolded notebook, change the SQL query in the third code cell (line 1) to the following. This will reduce the number of columns being used to train the model.

    ```SQL
    SELECT CUSTOMERNAME, CUSTOMERGROUP, BILLINGCOMPANYCODE, CUSTOMERACCOUNTGROUP,    CREDITCONTROLAREA, DISTRIBUTIONCHANNEL, ORGANIZATIONDIVISION, SALESDISTRICT,SALESORGANIZATION, SDDOCUMENTCATEGORY, CITYNAME, POSTALCODE, PAYMENTDELAYINDAYS FROM default.salespaymentsfull
    ```

    ![A portion of the scaffolded notebook displays with the SQL query replaced in the third cell.](media/ss_notebook_trainregressionmodel_querycell.png "Scaffolded AML notebook")

6. From the notebook toolbar menu, select **Run all** to execute all cells in the notebook. This notebook registers the dataset with Azure Machine Learning and creates an AutoML experiment to determine the best model to determine the incoming cashflow via predicting the payment delay in days. The best model is then registered with the Azure Machine Learning workspace.

    > **Note**: This notebook will run for approximately 20 minutes. Proceed to [Exercise 7](#exercise-7-visualize-historical-data-with-power-bi) and return here once completed.

7. Once the notebook has completed running, the output of the last cell will indicate the best model that is registered in the Azure Machine Learning workspace.

7. On the Predict with a model blade, fill in the database form as follows then select **Deploy model + open script**. This will create a table to hold the trained models as well as encapsulate the calling of the model with a stored procedure.

    | Field | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | Script type | Select **Stored procedure**. |
    | Stored procedure name | Enter `[dbo].[predict_cashflow]`. |
    | Database table | Select **Create new**. |
    | New table | Enter `[dbo].[ml_models]`. |

    ![The Predict with a model blade displays with a form populated with the preceding values. The Deploy model + open script button is highlighted.](media/ss_dbmodelspec.png "Deploy model to the database")

8. A script window opens with a query to create the stored procedure that leverages the trained regression model using the dbo.cashflow_prediction_tests table as input. At the end of the script the stored procedure is executed. The resulting values will include the predicted payment delay in days for each row in the **variable_out1** column. Execute the generated script and view the results.
